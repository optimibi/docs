# **User Creation and User Types**

## **Overview**

In **OptimiBI**, administrators can create new users and assign a **User Type** during the creation process. The selected user type determines the user's permissions within the system.

## **1. Accessing User Management**

1. **Log in** to the **OptimiBI Admin Panel**.
2. In the left-side menu, click **“User Management”**.
3. Select **“Create User”** to add a new user or edit an existing one.

## **2. Configuring User Information**

In the user editing interface, fill in the necessary details:

- **Login Name**: The unique identifier for the user.
- **Password**: Can be manually set or left blank for the user to set it.
- **Name**: The user’s full name.
- **Email**: The email address used for system notifications.
- **Company, Department, Title**: Optional fields that can be filled in as per organizational needs.
