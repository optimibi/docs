# **Report Page Size and Display Settings**

To ensure optimal report visibility across different screen sizes and aspect ratios, you can customize the page size and display settings accordingly.

## **Report Page Size Settings**

The **Page Size** setting is designed for report developers and can be adjusted in **Editing View** within the **Visualizations Pane**. This setting determines the canvas size in pixels and controls how the report scales:

<div align="left"><img src="./images/image-20230113143938541.png"  width="38%" /></div>

- **4:3 Aspect Ratio** – 1366 × 1024 px
- **16:9 Aspect Ratio (Default)** – 1366 × 765 px
- **Mobile View** – 320 × 568 px
- **Tablet View** – 1024 × 768 px
- **Custom Size** – Define height and width in pixels

## **Report Page View Settings**

The **View** menu in the toolbar provides multiple options to customize how reports are displayed on different devices.

- **Actual Size**: Displays the report in its true dimensions. This is useful when precise visual accuracy is needed, but scrolling may be required on smaller screens.
- **Fit to Width**: Adjusts the report width to match the screen size while maintaining its original height. A vertical scrollbar may still be necessary.
- **Fit to Page**: Scales the entire report to fit within the screen, eliminating the need for scrollbars while maximizing screen utilization.
- **Stretch**: Expands the report page to fill a large display, which is particularly useful when presenting on a projector or external monitor.

By leveraging these settings, you can ensure a seamless and optimized viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.
