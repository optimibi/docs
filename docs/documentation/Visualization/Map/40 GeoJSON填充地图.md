# GeoJSON Filled Map

A GeoJSON filled map combines GeoJSON-format map data with a dataset to fill different areas with different colors to display the data for different regions. GeoJSON is an open standard format that can be used to represent geospatial data. Using a GeoJSON filled map can more accurately display map data, such as administrative divisions like countries, provinces, and cities, while also providing a more intuitive way to visualize the data.

## Creating a Map

1. Create a new report in Datafor and add a GeoJSON marked map component in the report's design mode. This will add a blank map to the canvas area of the report designer.
