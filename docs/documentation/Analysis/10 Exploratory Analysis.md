## Overview

Optimibi offers powerful exploratory analysis capabilities that allow users to explore data in reports and dashboards in real-time.

## 1. Slicers

Slicers are visual filtering tools that allow you to dynamically filter data by selecting different slicer options.

[Reference Documentation](/documentation/Visualization/Filters/)

## 2. Component Filtering

Component filtering allows you to filter data based on specific criteria to display the most relevant information.

[Filtering and Data Selection](/documentation/Analysis/Component-Level-Filtering/)

## 3. Cross-Filtering

Cross-filtering and cross-highlighting enable automatic updates of related charts when a data point is selected in one chart, reflecting the related data.

[Reference Documentation](/documentation/Analysis/Cross-Filtering/)

## 4. Tooltips

Tooltips are detailed information boxes that appear when you hover over data points in charts.

[Reference Documentation](/documentation/Visualization/Tooltips-for-Chart-Components/)

## 5. Drillthrough

Drillthrough allows you to click on a data point in a report page and navigate to another page to see detailed information about that data point.

[Reference Documentation](/documentation/Analysis/Drill-through/)

## 6. Drill Down

Drill down enables you to view data at different levels of granularity in a chart, such as drilling down from yearly data to quarterly data.

[Reference Documentation](/documentation/Analysis/Drill-down/)

## 7. Sorting

Sorting allows you to arrange data in ascending or descending order based on a specific field.

[Reference Documentation](/documentation/Analysis/Sorting/)

## 8. Calculations

Calculations involve creating custom formulas and measures to compute complex data analysis results.
