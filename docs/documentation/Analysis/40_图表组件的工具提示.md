1. Understanding Tooltips

   ### What are Tooltips?

   Tooltips are small interactive boxes that appear when users hover over data points in Optimibi chart components. They provide contextual information about specific data points, such as data values and categories, helping users better understand and analyze the data.

   ### Benefits of Tooltips
