#### **New Features**  
1. **Added permission management** for **data source connections**.  
2. **New analysis models** now include `useAuth` by default, set to `false`. If the backend lacks this attribute, permissions will still be applied.  
3. **Added filtering capabilities** for "Date" and "Number" fields in **dimension tables**.  
4. **Model data permissions** now include user role configurations in the response.  
5. **User roles and data permissions** are now returned in a single request for efficiency.  
6. **Directory and file permissions retrieval** is now supported.  
7. **File uploads** are now stored in **JCR**, with added **CRUD and permission management interfaces**.  
8. **Multi-column sorting** is now available in **tables and pivot tables**.  

#### **Bug Fixes**  
1. Fixed an issue where **InfluxDB modeling** failed to retrieve table information on AWS.  
2. Resolved a bug where, in a **single-table model**, if **metrics and dimensions were edited to have no intersection**, selecting a table field in the topology view caused **property panel configuration errors**.  
3. Prevented users from selecting tables with **empty structures** in the **table view** when retrieved from a connection.  
4. Fixed an issue where **attribute sources could not be modified**.  
5. Resolved a bug where renaming an **analysis model** using the latest `rename` API **did not update the `schema.name` property** in the schema file, leading to report parsing errors.  
6. Fixed a problem where **the property panel disappeared** after dragging a **snowflake model relationship**.  
7. Addressed an issue where setting the `PRODUCT_LINE` field to **invisible** only applied to the **model view**, but queries could still retrieve `PRODUCT_LINE`.
