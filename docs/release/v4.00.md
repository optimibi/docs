6. Added an option to choose whether to display units in the metric card component.  
7. Enhanced the **Raw Data View** in components:

11. Fixed an issue where table and field names starting with a number caused an error when selecting a table in modeling without choosing a data connection.  
12. Addressed an issue where copying a metric card resulted in a loss of data formatting.  
13. Fixed an issue where adjusting metric positions in bar and line charts had no effect.

15. Corrected the **Rank** function’s sorting behavior to ensure proper ranking order.
