#### **New Features**  
1. Added **indentation for tree nodes** to improve readability.  
2. Standardized **icon buttons** for a consistent UI.  
3. The **Properties Panel** now displays field names as **read-only** (view-only, non-editable).  
4. Unified the **search functionality** across the **Analysis Model Editor**, with highlighted search results.  
5. Enabled **custom dictionary configuration** for attributes in the **Analysis Model Editor**.  
6. Restricted **file data source imports**—users without edit permissions can no longer append files.  
7. Added a **"Select Existing Table"** feature to the **file data source** section.  
8. Modified **MeasureGroup property display**, now stored directly in the `name` attribute.  
9. Enhanced the **metric card component**, allowing users to choose whether to display units.  

#### **Bug Fixes**  
1. Fixed an issue where **scrollbar positioning was incorrect** when switching screen zoom from **125% to 100%**.  
2. Resolved a UI bug where, if the **Analysis Model Editor** was opened without a maximized window, collapsing the right panel caused it to disappear.  
3. Fixed an issue in **permission settings** where deleting a row or column permission that belonged to the same record caused all records to be deleted.  
4. Addressed a **500 error** occurring when accessing the **file upload list** on the **Connections page** after a page refresh.  
5. Fixed an issue where saving an **Analysis Model opened via a plugin** resulted in an error.
